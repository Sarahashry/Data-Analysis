# ðŸ’³ Digital Wallet Transaction Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard built in **Microsoft Excel** to analyze digital wallet transaction data. It was created as part of my data analysis training to practice turning raw data into clear business insights.

The dashboard explores over **5,000 transactions** and visualizes key metrics such as:
- Total amount paid: **$24.6M+**

- Top-performing products, merchants, and categories
- Payment methods and device usage
- User segmentation by region and loyalty points

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Business Questions
